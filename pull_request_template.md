I've checked that:

* [ ] the query produces the intended results
* [ ] the folder name matches the schema name
* [ ] the schema name exists in Dune
* [ ] views are prefixed with `view_`, functions with `fn_`.
* [ ] the filename matches the defined view, table or function and ends with .sql
* [ ] each file has only one view, table or function defined  
* [ ] column names are `lowercase_snake_cased`
